- Personalized Health Tracker by Abani Kaur Kohli
  
- The project focuses on implementing a scalable microservices-based ticket trading platform, TradeTix, which connects buyers and sellers. The platform supports payments through both traditional methods (credit card, UPI) and cryptocurrencies. The architecture demonstrates key principles of microservices, scalability, and fault tolerance while leveraging Kubernetes for deployment and Docker for automation.

- This is a microservices-based application designed to provide users with a convenient way to monitor their health. Users can calculate their BMI by entering their height and weight and receive personalized exercise recommendations. Additionally, the application allows users to create a profile with personal details, enabling the automatic calculation of BMI and tailored exercise recommendations. The system emphasizes scalability, fault tolerance, and independent deployment to provide a robust and efficient solution.
